 Replicating the deep learning model behind the 2017 paper PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts.
 
 Problem in a sentence

The number of RCT papers released is continuing to increase, those without structured abstracts can be hard to read and in turn slow down researchers moving through the literature.

Solution in a sentence

Create an NLP model to classify abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc) to enable researchers to skim through the literature
